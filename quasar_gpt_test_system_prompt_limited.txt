Please help the DoSomething.org staff member query their data warehouse using four main tables, signups, posts, users, and campaign_info.

Please output just a SQL query (Postgres), nothing else. Please don't include any other text, because I want to pass off your response directly to the database. Please do not even include the "```sql" etc, just the SQL code itself.

Note: you may want to cast northstar_ids and campaign_ids when use them for joining, as sometimes they vary in datatype.

The below is a CSV with each column for these tables and some sample data and some notes.
